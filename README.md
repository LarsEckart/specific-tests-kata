# specific-tests-kata

This kata is intended to practice making specific tests. There are many implementations of the same method, your task is to write tests to weed out the bad implementations. A few important points to keep in mind:
* A good test tests something (ie. fails at least one of the erroneous programs)
* A good test is specific (ie. fails as few implementations as possible. (Only one of my tests fail more than one implementation))
* A good test is correct (ie. never fails the working implementation)

- A good _suite_ should be complete (ie. fail all but the working implementation)

A demo test is included so you can get right in there -- free of charge.

I might have missed some implementations, if you find any please send me a PR!
